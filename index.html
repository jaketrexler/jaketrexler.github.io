            <pre>Destroyer, my Creator
Grow the world around me
Burn it, while you’re at it
Or leave it be

Let it ooze
Drown it below
Or beat it senseless
It’s yours to keep, you decide

                <!-- <div class="img" style="height:200px;"></div> -->
                <pre>Your eyes open to see a blank, open sky
                    Awoken by the waves of rolling hills
                    Dropping taps of the sea within you
                    You soak in your fearful cage
                    
                    You can’t close the arrays 
                    The feeling of sight drifts upon you
                    The ocean grows 
                    But the waves crash
                    
                    You thrash with no avail,
                    Your light fades out
                    And you sink below
                    
                </pre>

                <h5></h5>
                <!-- <div class="img" style="height:200px;"></div> -->
                <pre>I know you watch this road
                    Your figure surrounds the lonely path I travel
                    You're everywhere
                    Aren't you?

                    These soft steps keep me from you
                    the baron trees absorb your gleam
                    Each muddy step gets firmer and firmer
                    Until I reach solid ground

                    Your gaze burns my eyes with a beautiful singe
                    You've waited all this time to show me your heaven
                    You gave me your eyes and took off your mask 

                    You showed me your world.

            <h2>Her Pearl</h2>
            <h5></h5>
            <!-- <div class="img" style="height:200px;"></div> -->
            <pre>I step outside waiting for Her to arrive
                Her spotted pearl of a watering eye 
                I walk aimlessly, and She travels with me silently
                And as I trek along this lonely path, Her ghostly glow accompanies my trip

                Her disfigured shape makes a mosaic of the stars
                A beautiful eye She has, watching my every move

                She travels unbothered, as I find a path of friendless grass to join

                I fall like a leaf and make my mark on this untouched forest of growing bush

                I look up and our eyes connect, forever cementing our love for each other
                I stare in silence, admiring her blissful beauty
                Her gleam waters my eyes and touches my soul
                She kisses my forehead and disappears

                I'm not worthy of such a perfect night,
                But Her gift unto me is forever priceless

                Without Her, the world is bleak
                And yet, She makes my nights worth living.

            <h5></h5>
            <!-- <div class="img" style="height:200px;"></div> -->
            <pre>The disgusting taste of freedom we all long for 
                The sour eats away the insides, begging to come out 
                One hour, a grueling testimony is repeated by hundreds

                A golden kiss before it's washed away 
                Expired too quick, a fresh kill turns rotten
                One minute, a bittersweet expectation of a soaked hoarde

                Feelings of hope, shrouded in a gloom of despair
                Rains approach, floodgates open, hoping for a light mist,

                It turns blue.
